I interpret user needs by first listening to the user about what they would like the software I am working on to have as a feature. This user story is then drafted into working code as a function within the program, which is then tested for its usability as well as
 against any pass/fail criteria relevant to that specific function. The creation of user stores helps as each story represents a task in development for the requested feature that is prioritized based on its usefulness to the entire program. When it comes to
 how I approach developing programs and an agile process I hope to incorporate into my future work as a developer, I particularly find participating in daily scrum as an invaluable tool for the team I will be a part of some day. By working in a collaborative 
 nature I feel as though I will progress in my career and learn my field much faster than I would as just a member of a team that does not value communication as much as a scrum team. Combining this with my love for organizational skills, having a well
 prioritized backlog is also going to be a goal in my future career. And finally, to be a good team member in software development to me means that you are someone who participates in team-building activities, know your specific skills and how to aid another 
 team member who may be struggling in a field that you know very well, as well as someone who is committed to improving in future work, as noone will ever be perfect and there is never not room for improvement.
